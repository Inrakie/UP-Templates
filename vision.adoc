approves funding
and so forth]
|===

===	User Environment
Detail the working environment of the target user. Here are some suggestions:

. Number of people involved in completing the task? Is this changing?
. How long is a task cycle? Amount of time spent in each activity? Is this changing?
. Any unique environmental constraints: mobile, outdoors, in-flight, and so on?
. Which system platforms are in use today? Future platforms?
. What other applications are in use? Does your application need to integrate with them?

This is where extracts from the Business Model could be included to outline the task and roles involved, and so on.

==	Product Overview
===	Needs and Features
//Avoid design. Keep feature descriptions at a general level. Focus on capabilities needed and why (not how) they should be implemented. Capture the stakeholder priority and planned release for each feature.

== Other Product Requirements
. At a high level, list applicable standards, hardware, or platform requirements; performance requirements; and environmental requirements.
. Define the quality ranges for performance, robustness, fault tolerance, usability, and similar characteristics that are not captured in the Feature Set.
. Note any design constraints, external constraints, assumptions or other dependencies that, if changed, will alter the Vision document. For example, an assumption may state that a specific operating system will be available for the hardware designated for the software product. If the operating system is not available, the Vision document will need to change.
. Define any specific documentation requirements, including user manuals, online help, installation, labeling, and packaging requirements.
. Define the priority of these other product requirements. Include, if useful, attributes such as stability, benefit, effort, and risk.
